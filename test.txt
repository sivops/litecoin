Script kiddies: Source or come up with a text manipulation problem and solve it with at least two of awk, sed, tr and / or grep.

Note1: used gsed instead of sed as I am using macOS
Note2: `$` means command here
Note3: sample.text is the text manipulation file
Note4: test.txt is the step by step description file for the test assigned

# creating a file with sample sentences
$ echo "Hello world! this is a simple text file" > sample.text

# view the file contents using awk
$ awk '{print}' sample.text 
Hello world! this is a simple text file

# print the line if it finds the word "simple"
$ awk '/simple/' sample.text
Hello world! this is a simple text file

##### using "gsed" to replace the word "simple" with "sample"
$ gsed -i 's|simple|sample|g' sample.text 

$ awk '{print}' sample.text
Hello world! this is a sample text file
